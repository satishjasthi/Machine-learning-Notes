BAYESIAN STATISTICS:(course: Coursera,Introduction to Bayesian statistics)

Bayes rule:
	  P(A&B) * P(A)
P(A|B) = --------------------
	      P(B)



In baysian stats we have something called Confusion matrix,
where 

True positive is called sensitivity
True negative is called specitivity 

We can update the priors using the calculated posteriors in the previous step.
