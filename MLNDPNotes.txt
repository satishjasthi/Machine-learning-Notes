In machine learning there are 3 type:
1.Predictive or Supervise
2.Descriptive or Unsupervised
3.Reinforcement learning

3.Knowledge discovery: is a process of finding the hidden patterns with in the unlabeled data.In case of unsupervised learning(USL) we don't have any error metric to evaluate our performance.


*SUPERVISED LEARNING:
=======================

CLASSIFICATION:
==============
In classification the output y E (1,2,...C), where E = belongs to & 
C = number of classes.
if y E (0,1) or C =2 then it is called binary classification

if C>2 then it is called multiclass classification.

But if the labels are not mutually exclusive then the algorithm ouputs more than one lable(like tall and strong).This is called multi label classification or multiple ouput model.
Unless it is specified it is always assumed that the output of a multiclass classification is single ouput.

Function approximation:
======================
Usually in classification we are given a set of input data x and we assume a relation between y and x as

y = f(x)

and our task to find/learn/approximate the true function f using the values of x , so we define

y^ = f^(x) where ^ represents estimated value.

where f^(x) is an approximation of f(x) to predict the value y.Our goal is to make prediction on a novel inputs ,means ones that we have not seen before(also called generalisation)

Probabilistic perspective:
=========================

we can represent the above model as 

y^ = argmax{c=1 to c}(p(y = c|x,D))....1.0

where, x = input test vector (single case)
D = training set
argmax returns the class with highest probability
y^ gives us the most probable class 


The ouput of 1.0 is called mode of distribution p(y|x,D).And it is also called as MAP estimate(Maximum a posterior)

You must perform exploratory data analysis before choosing the algorithm and working with them.


Image classification is different from object classification, because object classification/detection is a subset of image classification, where you'll identify the objects with the image
